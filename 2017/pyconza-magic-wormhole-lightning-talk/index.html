Long ago, Glyph lamented that all he wanted to do was send a file over the internet. Since then, very little has changed.

If you want to send a file to someone, you either attach it to an email, or you upload it to some central, cloud-based service that you both have access to: Google Drive; Dropbox; iCloud; etc.

But what if you don’t want to do that? What if you want to send a file directly to someone, without intermediaries?
